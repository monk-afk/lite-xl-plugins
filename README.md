# Lite XL plugins

Plugins for the [Lite XL text editor](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl),
originally forked from the [lite plugins repository](https://github.com/rxi/lite-plugins).

If you can't find a plugin that suits your needs, check if someone has already
created an issue about it, otherwise feel free to create one yourself.

## How to install

To install a plugin:

*   If the plugin links to a repository, follow its `README`.
*   If the plugin is a single file or directory, drop it directly in:

    *   Linux `~/.config/lite-xl/plugins/`
    *   MacOS `~/.config/lite-xl/plugins/`
    *   Windows `C:\Users\(username)\.config\lite-xl\plugins\`

Or, if you have a Lite XL plugin manager, such as [`lpm`](https://github.com/adamharrison/lite-xl-plugin-manager),
you may install plugins by doing

```
  lpm install plugin_name
```

*Note: if you make a pull request, do not edit this README.md file, as it's autogenerated;
the manifest.json file should be updated to include any new plugins added, as specified in the
[Lite XL plugin manifest specification](https://github.com/adamharrison/lite-xl-plugin-manager/blob/master/SPEC.md).*

*Please note, that in this official repository, any plugins that specify a `remote` must also
pin the remote to a specific commit hash. Any plugin that is hosted not in a repository,
but only with a `url` must provide a `checksum` that matches the existing plugin.*

*Any commits specified with a `remote` will automatically be checked for updates to the `latest` branch, and PRs will
automaticaly be created for them on a recurring basis to keep things up to date. Stubs can specify an alternate branch
to follow with `extra.follow_branch`.*

*Any non-conforming PRs will not be accepted. The table below will be updated automatically.*

*Any entries marked with an asterisk are hosted on external repositories.*
